Linear search is a search algorithm that starts from the beginning of a list, and checks each element until the search key is found or the end of the list is reached.
Binary search is a faster algorithm for searching a list if the list's elements are sorted and directly accessible (such as an array). Binary search first checks the middle element of the list. If the search key is found, the algorithm returns the matching location.
